# Plucking-Mangoes
This summer, Juno is visiting his granny. There he saw a huge mango tree in grannyâ€™s garden and Juno wanted to eat a few mangoes.  Since it was a huge mango tree, Juno was unable to jump and grab the mangoes. He immediately starts looking around for a way to pluck these mangoes.  Juno happens to find a stone which he decides to aim at the mangoes and get them.
